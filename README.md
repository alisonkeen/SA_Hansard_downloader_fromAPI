## SA Hansard Downloader - using API

Exploring the SA Hansard API, a bit at a time... 

/currently:
 - downloads the Annual index for 2016
 - parses the JSON for each 'event' (a day when Hansard exists)

This doesn't work on Morph.io because it needs adapting to parse the JSON response directly without saving and reopening it. 

This is currently *very* in development, I am still slowly learning Ruby and its coding conventions.
