## SA Hansard Downloader - using API

Exploring the SA Hansard API, a bit at a time... 

/currently:
 - downloads the Annual index for 2016
 - parses the JSON for each 'event' (a day when Hansard exists)

This is currently *very* in development, I am still slowly learning Ruby and its coding conventions. 

I studied computer science 2005-2010, but in the last six months, after two years of no programming, have hit a number of firsts: 
 - first ruby code
 - first web scraper
 - first attempt to parse JSON (not actually tried XML yet)
 - first open source project
 - first time using APIs properly 

... All good things to learn, and all new to me! Sorry for the bugs, eyeball bleeds over bad syntax and formatting. Over time it should improve.
